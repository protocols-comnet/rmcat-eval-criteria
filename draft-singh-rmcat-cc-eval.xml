            <t>This memo describes the guidelines to help with evaluating
            new congestion control algorithms for interactive
            point-to-point real time media. The requirements for the
            congestion control algorithm are outlined in <xref
            target="I-D.jesup-rtp-congestion-reqs" />). This document
            builds upon previous work at the IETF: <xref
            target="RFC5033">Specifying New Congestion Control
            Algorithms</xref> and <xref target="RFC5166">Metrics for the
            Evaluation of Congestion Control Algorithms</xref>.</t>
            
            <t>The guidelines proposed in the document are intended to
            prevent a congestion collapse, promote fair capacity usage and
            optimize the media flow's throughput, delay, loss and quality.
            Furthermore, the proposed algorithms are expected to operate
            within the envelope of the circuit breakers defined in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers" />.</t>
            
            <t>This document only provides broad-level criteria for
            evaluating a new congestion control algorithm and the working
            group should expect a thorough scientific study to make its
            decision. The results of the evaluation are not expected to be
            included within the internet-draft but should be cited in the
            document.</t>

            <t><xref target="RFC5166" /> describes the basic metrics for
            congestion control. Metrics that are important to interactive
            multimedia are:

            <t> Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC5166" /> discusses the

            <t> <list style="empty">
                <t>(i) Bandwidth Utilization: is the ratio of the encoding

                metrics. Similarly, there exist several metrics to measure
                video quality, for example Peak Signal to Noise Ratio

            <t>A congestion control algorithm should be tested in
            simulation or a testbed environment, and the experiments should
            be repeated multiple times to infer statistical significance.
            The following guidelines are considered for evaluation:</t>
            
            <section title="Avoiding Congestion Collapse">
            <t>Does the congestion control propose any changes to (or
            diverge from) the circuit breaker conditions defined in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers" />.</t>
            </section>
            
            <section title="Stability">
            <t>The congestion control should be assessed for its stability
            when the path characteristics do not change over time. Changing
            the media encoding rate too often or by too much may adversely
            affect the users' quality of experience.</t>
            </section>
            
            <section title="Diverse Environments">
            <t>The congestion control algorithm should be assessed in
            heterogeneous environments, containing both wired and wireless
            paths. Examples of wireless access technologies are: 802.11x,
            HSPA, WCDMA, or GPRS. One of the main challenges of the
            wireless environments is the inability to distinguish
            congestion induced loss from transmission (bit-error) loss.
            Congestion control algorithms may incorrectly identify
            transmission loss as congestion loss and reduce the media
            encoding rate too much, which may cause oscillatory behavior
            and deteriorate the users' quality of experience. Furthermore,
            packet loss may induce additional delay in networks with
            wireless paths due to link-layer retransmissions.</t>
            </section>
            
            <section title="Varying Path Characteristics">
            <t>The congestion control algorithm should be evaluated for a
            range of path characteristics such as, different end-to-end
            capacity and latency, varying amount of cross traffic on a
            bottle-neck link and a router's queue length. [Editor's Note:
            Different types of queueing mechanisms? Random Early Detection
            or only DropTail?]. The main motivation for the previous and
            current criteria is to determine under which circumstances will
            the proposed congestion control algorithm break down and also
            determine the operational range of the algorithm.</t>
            </section>
            
            <section title="Reacting to Transient Events or Interruptions">
            <t>The congestion control algorithm should be able to handle
            changes in end-to-end capacity and latency. Latency may change
            due to route updates, link failures, handovers etc. In mobile
            environment the end-to-end capacity may vary due to the
            interference, fading, handovers, etc. In wired networks the
            end-to-end capacity may vary due to changes in resource
            reservation.</t>
            </section>

            <section title="Fairness With Similar Cross-Traffic">
            <t>The congestion control algorithm should be evaluated when
            competing with other RTP flows using the same congestion
            control algorithm. The proposal should highlight the bottleneck
            capacity share of each RTP flow.</t>
            </section>
            
            <section title="Impact on Cross-Traffic">
            <t>The congestion control algorithm should be evaluated when
            competing with standard TCP. Short TCP flows may be considered
            as transient events and the RTP flow may give way to the short
            TCP flow to complete quickly. However, long-lived TCP flows may
            starve out the RTP flow depending on router queue length. In
            the latter case the proposed congestion control for RTP should
            be as aggressive as <xref target="RFC5681">standard
            TCP</xref>.</t>
            </section>
            
            <section title="Extensions to RTP/RTCP">
            <t>The congestion control algorithm should indicate if any
            protocol extensions are required to implement it and should
            carefully describe the impact of the extension.</t>

        </section>
        
        <section title="Example Evaluation Scenarios" anchor="cc-scenario">
            <t>In the scenarios listed below, all RTP flows are
            bi-directional and point-to-point.</t>
            
            <t><list style="empty">
            <t>[S1] RTP flow on a fixed link: This scenario evaluates the
            ramp-up to the bottleneck capacity and the stability of the
            proposed congestion control algorithm.</t>
            <t></t>
            
            <t>[S2] RTP flow on a variable capacity link: This scenario
            evaluates the reactivity of the proposed congestion control
            algorithm to transient network events due to interference and
            handovers in mobile environments. Sample 3G bandwidth traces
            are available at <xref target="3GPP.R1.081955" />.</t>
            <t></t>
            
            <t>[S3] Fairness to RTP flows running the same congestion
            control algorithm: This scenario shows if the proposed
            algorithm can share the bottleneck link equitably, irrespective
            of number of flows.</t>
            <t></t>
            
            <t>[S4] Competing with long-lived TCP flows: In this scenario
            the proposed algorithm is expected to be TCP-friendly, i.e., it
            should neither starve out the competing TCP flows (causing a
            congestion collapse) nor should it be starved out by TCP.</t>
            <t></t>
            
            <t>[S5] Competing with short TCP flows: Depending on the level
            of statistical multiplexing on the bottleneck link, the
            proposed algorithm may behave differently. If there are a few
            short TCP flows then the proposed algorithm may observe these
            flows as transient events and let them complete quickly.
            Alternatively, if there are many short flows then the proposed
            algorithm may have to compete with the flows as if they were
            long lived TCP flows. [Editor's Note: many and few short TCP
            flows may depend on the bottleneck link capacity.]</t>

            <t>Congestion control algorithms are expected to be published
            as "Experimental" documents until they are shown to be safe to
            deploy. An algorithm published as a draft should be

            algorithm should include a note describing the environments in

            describes Informational proposals as algorithms that are not
