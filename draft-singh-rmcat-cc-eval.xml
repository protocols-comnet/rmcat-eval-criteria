            <t>This memo describes the guidelines to help with evaluating
            new congestion control algorithms for interactive
            point-to-point real time media. The requirements for the
            congestion control algorithm are outlined in <xref
            target="I-D.jesup-rmcat-reqs" />). This document
            builds upon previous work at the IETF: <xref
            target="RFC5033">Specifying New Congestion Control
            Algorithms</xref> and <xref target="RFC5166">Metrics for the
            Evaluation of Congestion Control Algorithms</xref>.</t>
            
            <t>The guidelines proposed in the document are intended to prevent
            a congestion collapse, promote fair capacity usage and optimize
            the media flow's throughput, and quality. Furthermore, the
            proposed algorithms are expected to operate within the envelope of
            the circuit breakers defined in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers" />.</t>
            
            <t>This document only provides broad-level criteria for
            evaluating a new congestion control algorithm and the working
            group should expect a thorough scientific study to make its
            decision. The results of the evaluation are not expected to be
            included within the internet-draft but should be cited in the
            document.</t>

        <section title="Metrics" anchor="cc-metrics"> 
            
        <t><xref target="RFC5166" /> describes the basic metrics for
        congestion control. Metrics that are important to interactive
        multimedia are:
        <list style="symbols"> 
            <t>Throughput</t> 
            <t>Minimizing oscillations in encoding rate (stability)</t>
            <t>Delay</t> <t>Reactivity to transient events</t>
            <t>Packet losses and discards.</t>
            <t>Users' quality of experience</t> 
        </list></t>
        
         <t>Each experiment logs every incoming and outgoing packet. The
         logging can be done inside the application or at the endpoints using
         pcap (packet capture, e.g., tcpdump, wireshark). The following
         are measured based on the information in the logs:
         <list style="numbers"> 
            <t>Sending rate, Receiver rate, Goodput</t> 
            <t>Packet latency</t>
            <t>Packet loss</t>
            <t>Post-repair loss: residual loss after retransmission or
            FEC.</t>
            <t>Packets discarded from the playout or de-jitter buffer</t>
<!--            <t>(v) Unfairness</t> -->
        </list></t>
        
        <t>[Open issue (1): Instead of defining fairness, there has been
        discussion on defining "unfairness". The criteria are:<vspace />
            1. Do not trigger the circuit breaker.<vspace />
            2. Over 3 times or less than 1/3 times the throughput for a stream
            compared to similar competing streams on a bottleneck. The
            competing streams have similar RTTs.<vspace />
            3. Over 3 times delay compared to RTT measurements performed
            before starting the flow.<vspace />
            Here, rather than discussing the number, do people agree with the
            criteria?
        ]</t>
        
        <t>[Open issue (2): Convergence time was discussed briefly in the
        meetings as well. It is defined as: time it takes the congestion
        control to reach a stable rate (at startup or after new RMCAT flows
        are added). What is stable rate?]</t>
        
        <t>[Open issue (3): previous versions of the document had Bandwidth
        Utilization, defined as ratio of sending rate to the available
        bottleneck capacity. This makes sense when the RMCAT flow is by itself
        or competing with similar flows (where the assumption would be that
        all flows get an equal share). rate fairness may not always be the
        case, so remove this?]</t>
        
        <t>From the logs the statistical measures (min, max, mean, standard
        deviation and variance) for the whole duration of the call can be
        calculated for each metric.</t>
        
        
        <t> Also the metrics (sending rate, receiver rate, goodput, latency)
        can be visualized in graphs as variation over time, the measurements
        in the plot are at 1 second intervals. Additionally, from the logs it
        should be possible to plot the histogram or CDF of delay.</t>
        
        <t>Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC5166" /> discusses the tradeoff
        between throughput, delay and loss.</t>
        
        <t>[Open issue (4): Application trade-off is yet to be defined. see
        <xref target="I-D.jesup-rmcat-reqs">RMCAT requirements</xref>

        (E-model/R-model). Section 4.7 of <xref target="RFC3611" /> can also
        be used for VoIP metrics. Similarly, there exist several metrics to
        measure video quality, for example Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR).
        </t>

        <t>[Editor's Note: Should the algorithm compare average PSNR of test
        video sequences or what other video quality metric can be used? If
        Quality is used as a metric, it should not be the only metric used to
        compare rate-control schemes. Also, algorithms using different codecs
        cannot be compared]. </t>

            The following guidelines are considered for evaluation:</t>

            <t>Does the congestion control propose any changes to (or

            </section>
            
            <section title="Stability">
            <t>The congestion control should be assessed for its stability
            when the path characteristics do not change over time. Changing
            the media encoding rate too often or by too much may adversely
            affect the users' quality of experience.</t>

            <section title ="Media Traffic">
            <t>The congestion control algorithm should be assessed with
            different types of media behavior, i.e., the media should contain
            idle and data-limited periods. For example, periods of silence for
            audio or varying amount of motion for video. However, the
            evaluation can be done in two stages. In the first stage, media
            stream can generate traffic at the rate calculated by the 
            congestion controller. In the second stage, real codecs or models
            of video codecs should be used to mimic real-world cases.</t>

            <t>The congestion control algorithm should be assessed with 
            different start-rates. The main reason is to observe the behavior
            of the congestion control in different evaluation scenarios, such 
            as when competing with varying amount of cross-traffic or how 
            quickly does the congestion control algorithm achieve a stable 
            sending rate.</t>

            <t>The congestion control algorithm should be assessed in
            heterogeneous environments, containing both wired and wireless
            paths. Examples of wireless access technologies are: 802.11, GPRS,
            HSPA, or LTE. One of the main challenges of the wireless
            environments for the congestion control algorithm is to
            distinguish between congestion induced loss and transmission
            (bit-error corruption) loss. Congestion control algorithms may
            incorrectly identify transmission loss as congestion loss and
            reduce the media encoding rate by too much, which may cause
            oscillatory behavior and deteriorate the users' quality of
            experience. Furthermore, packet loss may induce additional delay
            in networks with wireless paths due to link-layer
            retransmissions.</t>

            <section title="Varying Path Characteristics">
            <t>The congestion control algorithm should be evaluated for a
            range of path characteristics such as, different end-to-end
            capacity and latency, varying amount of cross traffic on a
            bottle-neck link and a router's queue length. In an experiment, if
            the media only flows in a single direction, the feedback path
            should also be tested with varying amounts of impairments.</t>
            
            <t>The main motivation for the previous and current criteria is to
            identify situations in which the proposed congestion control is
            less performant.</t>

            <section title="Reacting to Transient Events or Interruptions">
            <t>The congestion control algorithm should be able to handle
            changes in end-to-end capacity and latency. Latency may change
            due to route updates, link failures, handovers etc. In mobile
            environment the end-to-end capacity may vary due to the
            interference, fading, handovers, etc. In wired networks the
            end-to-end capacity may vary due to changes in resource
            reservation.</t>

            congestion control algorithm. The proposal should highlight the
            bottleneck capacity share of each RTP flow.</t>

            competing with standard TCP. Short TCP flows may be considered
            as transient events and the RTP flow may give way to the short
            TCP flow to complete quickly. However, long-lived TCP flows may
            starve out the RTP flow depending on router queue length. </t>

            </t>

            <t>Each congestion control algorithm should plot the variation of the 
            sending rate against time, also plot the instances of packets losses.
            Additionally, measure the time taken for the sending rate to reach 
            the end-to-end capacity (average and standard deviation over 
            10 simulation runs).

            <t>[S4] Competing with long-lived TCP flows: In this scenario
            the proposed algorithm is expected to be TCP-friendly, i.e., it
            should neither starve out the competing TCP flows (causing a
            congestion collapse) nor should it be starved out by TCP.</t>

            <t>[S5] Competing with short TCP flows: Depending on the level
            of statistical multiplexing on the bottleneck link, the
            proposed algorithm may behave differently. If there are a few
            short TCP flows then the proposed algorithm may observe these
            flows as transient events and let them complete quickly.
            Alternatively, if there are many short flows then the proposed
            algorithm may have to compete with the flows as if they were
            long lived TCP flows.</t>

            <t>Congestion control algorithms are expected to be published
            as "Experimental" documents until they are shown to be safe to
            deploy. An algorithm published as a draft should be
            experimented in simulation, or a controlled environment
            (testbed) to show its applicability. Every congestion control
            algorithm should include a note describing the environments in
            which the algorithm is tested and safe to deploy. It is
            possible that an algorithm is not recommended for certain
            environments or perform sub-optimally for the user.</t>

            describes Informational proposals as algorithms that are not
            safe for deployment but are proposals to experiment with in
            simulation/testbeds. While Experimental algorithms are ones
            that are deemed safe in some environments but require a more
