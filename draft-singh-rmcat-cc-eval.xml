            <t>This memo describes the guidelines to help with evaluating
            new congestion control algorithms for interactive
            point-to-point real time media. The requirements for the
            congestion control algorithm are outlined in <xref
            target="I-D.jesup-rtp-congestion-reqs" />). This document
            builds upon previous work at the IETF: <xref
            target="RFC5033">Specifying New Congestion Control
            Algorithms</xref> and <xref target="RFC5166">Metrics for the
            Evaluation of Congestion Control Algorithms</xref>.</t>
            
            <t>The guidelines proposed in the document are intended to
            prevent a congestion collapse, promote fair capacity usage and
            optimize the media flow's throughput, delay, loss and quality.
            Furthermore, the proposed algorithms are expected to operate
            within the envelope of the circuit breakers defined in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers" />.</t>
            
            <t>This document only provides broad-level criteria for
            evaluating a new congestion control algorithm and the working
            group should expect a thorough scientific study to make its
            decision. The results of the evaluation are not expected to be
            included within the internet-draft but should be cited in the
            document.</t>

        <section title="Guidelines" anchor="cc-guidelines">
            <t>A congestion control algorithm should be tested in
            simulation or a testbed environment, and repeated multiple
            times to infer statistical significance. The following 
            guidelines may be considered for evaluation:</t>

            <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Avoiding Congestion Collapse: Does the congestion control
            propose any changes to (or diverge from) the <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers" >circuit breaker
            conditions</xref> for avoiding congestion collapse.</t>
            
            <t>Stability: changing the media encoding rate too often or by
            too much may adversely affect the users' quality of
            experience.</t>
            
            <t>Diverse environments: The congestion control algorithm
            should be assessed in heterogeneous environments, containing
            both wired and wireless paths. Examples of wireless
            technologies are: 802.11x, HSPA, WCDMA, or GPRS. One of the
            main challenges of the wireless environments is the inability
            to distinguish congestion induced loss from transmission
            (bit-error) loss. Furthermore, packet loss may induce
            additional delay in networks with wireless paths due to
            link-layer retransmissions.</t>
            
            <t>Varying path characteristics: The congestion control
            algorithm should be evaluated for a range of path
            characteristics such as, different end-to-end capacity and
            latency, varying amount of cross traffic on a bottle-neck link
            and a router's queue length. [Editor's Note: Different types of
            queueing mechanisms? Random Early Detection or only DropTail?].
            The main motivation for the previous and current criteria is to
            figure out under what circumstances will the congestion control
            algorithm break down and in which environments it may be safe
            to deploy.</t>
            
            <t>Reacting to transient events or interruptions: The
            congestion control algorithm should be able to handle changes
            in end-to-end latency due to route updates, link failures,
            handovers etc. In mobile environment the end-to-end capacity
            may vary due to the interference, fading, handovers, etc. In
            wired networks the end-to-end capacity may vary due to changes
            in resource reservation.</t>
            
            <t>Fairness with similar cross-traffic: The congestion control
            algorithm should be evaluated when competing with other RTP
            flows using the same congestion control algorithm. The proposal
            should highlight the bottleneck capacity share of each RTP
            flow.</t>
            
            <t>Impact on cross-traffic: The congestion control algorithm
            should be evaluated when competing with standard TCP. Short TCP
            flows may be considered as transient events and the RTP flow
            may give way to the short TCP flow to complete quickly.
            However, long TCP flows (also known as elephant flows) may
            starve out the RTP flow depending on router queue length. In
            the latter case the proposed congestion control for RTP should
            be as aggressive as <xref target="RFC5681">standard
            TCP</xref>.</t>
            
            <t>Extensions to RTP/RTCP: The congestion control algorithm
            should indicate if any protocol extensions are required to
            implement it and should carefully describe the impact of the
            extension.</t>

            <t>Congestion control algorithms are expected to be published
            as "Experimental" documents until they are shown to be safe to
            deploy. An algorithm published as a draft should be
            experimented in simulation, or a controlled environment
            (testbed) to show its applicability. Every congestion control
            algorithm should include a note describing the environments in
            which the algorithm is tested and safe to deploy. It is
            possible that an algorithm is not recommended for certain
            environments or perform sub-optimally for the user.</t>
            
            <t>[Editors Note: Should there be a distinction between
            "Informational" and "Experimental" drafts for congestion
            control algorithms in RMCAT. <xref target="RFC5033" />
            describes Informational proposals as algorithms that are not
            safe for deployment but are proposals to experiment with in
            simulation/testbeds. While Experimental algorithms are ones
            that are deemed safe in some environments but require a more
            thorough evaluation (from the community).]</t>
