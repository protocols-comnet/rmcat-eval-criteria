Internet-Draft   Evaluating Congestion Control for RMCAT    October 2012


1.  Introduction

   This memo describes the guidelines to help with evaluating new
   congestion control algorithms for interactive point-to-point real
   time media.  The requirements for the congestion control algorithm
   are outlined in [I-D.jesup-rtp-congestion-reqs]).  This document
   builds upon previous work at the IETF: Specifying New Congestion
   Control Algorithms [RFC5033] and Metrics for the Evaluation of
   Congestion Control Algorithms [RFC5166].

   The guidelines proposed in the document are intended to prevent a
   congestion collapse, promote fair capacity usage and optimize the
   media flow's throughput, delay, loss and quality.  Furthermore, the
   proposed algorithms are expected to operate within the envelope of
   the circuit breakers defined in
   [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers].

   This document only provides broad-level criteria for evaluating a new
   congestion control algorithm and the working group should expect a
   thorough scientific study to make its decision.  The results of the
   evaluation are not expected to be included within the internet-draft
   but should be cited in the document.


2.  Terminology

   [Editor's Note: Should the document use RFC2119 language.]

   The terminology defined in RTP [RFC3550], RTP Profile for Audio and
   Video Conferences with Minimal Control [RFC3551], RTCP Extended
   Report (XR) [RFC3611], Extended RTP Profile for RTCP-based Feedback
   (RTP/AVPF) [RFC4585] and Support for Reduced-Size RTCP [RFC5506]
   apply.


3.  Metrics

   [RFC5166] describes the basic metrics for congestion control.
   Metrics that are important to interactive multimedia are:
   o  Delay
   o  Throughput
   o  Users' quality of experience
   o  Minimizing oscillations in encoding rate
   o  Reactivity to transient events
   o  Packet loss and discard rate
   Section 2.1 of [RFC5166] discusses the tradeoff between throughput,
   delay and loss.

      (i) Bandwidth Utilization: is the ratio of the encoding rate to
      the (available) end-to-end network capacity.
      *  Under-utilization: is the period of time when the endpoint's
         encoding rate is lower than the end-to-end capacity, i.e., the
         bandwidth utilization is less than 1.
      *  Overuse: is the period of time when the endpoint's encoding
         rate is higher than the end-to-end capacity, i.e., the
         bandwidth utilization is greater than 1.
      *  Stability: is the period of time when the endpoint's encoding
         rate is relatively stable, i.e., the bandwidth utilization is
         constant.
      (ii) Packet Loss and Discard Rate.
      (iii) Quality
   [TBD]

   [Editor's Note: Should the algorithm also compare average PSNR of
   test video sequences?]


4.  Guidelines

   A congestion control algorithm should be tested in simulation or a
   testbed environment, and repeated multiple times to infer statistical
   significance.  The following guidelines may be considered for
   evaluation:

   1.  Avoiding Congestion Collapse: Does the congestion control propose
       any changes to (or diverge from) the circuit breaker conditions
       defined in [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers].
   2.  Stability: The congestion control should be assessed for its
       stability when the path characteristics do not change over time.
       Changing the media encoding rate too often or by too much may
       adversely affect the users' quality of experience.
   3.  Diverse environments: The congestion control algorithm should be
       assessed in heterogeneous environments, containing both wired and
       wireless paths.  Examples of wireless access technologies are:
       802.11x, HSPA, WCDMA, or GPRS.  One of the main challenges of the
       wireless environments is the inability to distinguish congestion
       induced loss from transmission (bit-error) loss.  Congestion
       control algorithms may incorrectly identify transmission loss as
       congestion loss and reduce the media encoding rate too much,
       which may cause oscillatory behavior and deteriorate the users'
       quality of experience.  Furthermore, packet loss may induce
       additional delay in networks with wireless paths due to link-
       layer retransmissions.
   4.  Varying path characteristics: The congestion control algorithm
       should be evaluated for a range of path characteristics such as,
       different end-to-end capacity and latency, varying amount of

       cross traffic on a bottle-neck link and a router's queue length.
       [Editor's Note: Different types of queueing mechanisms?  Random
       Early Detection or only DropTail?].  The main motivation for the
       previous and current criteria is to figure out under what
       circumstances will the proposed congestion control algorithm
       break down and in which environments it may be safe to deploy.
   5.  Reacting to transient events or interruptions: The congestion
       control algorithm should be able to handle changes in end-to-end
       capacity and latency.  Latency may change due to route updates,
       link failures, handovers etc.  In mobile environment the end-to-
       end capacity may vary due to the interference, fading, handovers,
       etc.  In wired networks the end-to-end capacity may vary due to
       changes in resource reservation.
   6.  Fairness with similar cross-traffic: The congestion control
       algorithm should be evaluated when competing with other RTP flows
       using the same congestion control algorithm.  The proposal should
       highlight the bottleneck capacity share of each RTP flow.
   7.  Impact on cross-traffic: The congestion control algorithm should
       be evaluated when competing with standard TCP.  Short TCP flows
       may be considered as transient events and the RTP flow may give
       way to the short TCP flow to complete quickly.  However, long-
       lived TCP flows may starve out the RTP flow depending on router
       queue length.  In the latter case the proposed congestion control
       for RTP should be as aggressive as standard TCP [RFC5681].
   8.  Extensions to RTP/RTCP: The congestion control algorithm should
       indicate if any protocol extensions are required to implement it
       and should carefully describe the impact of the extension.

4.1.  Minimum Requirements for Evaluation

   [Editor's Note: The minimum set should be based on the above set of
   guidelines]


5.  Example Evaluation Scenarios

   In the scenarios listed below, all RTP flows are bi-directional and
   point-to-point.

   o  RTP flow on a fixed link: This scenario evaluates the ramp-up to
      the bottleneck capacity and the stability of the proposed
      congestion control algorithm.
   o  RTP flow on a variable capacity link: This scenario evaluates the
      reactivity of the proposed congestion control algorithm to
      transient network events due to interference and handovers in
      mobile environments.  Sample 3G bandwidth traces are available at
      [3GPP.R1.081955].

Internet-Draft   Evaluating Congestion Control for RMCAT    October 2012


   o  Fairness to RTP flows running the same congestion control
      algorithm: This scenario shows if the proposed algorithm can share
      the bottleneck link equitably, irrespective of number of flows.
   o  Competing with long-lived TCP flows: In this scenario the proposed
      algorithm is expected to be TCP-friendly, i.e., it should neither
      starve out the competing TCP flows (causing a congestion collapse)
      nor should it be starved out by TCP.
   o  Competing with short TCP flows: Depending on the level of
      statistical multiplexing on the bottleneck link, the proposed
      algorithm may behave differently.  If there are a few short TCP
      flows then the proposed algorithm may observe these flows as
      transient events and let them complete quickly.  Alternatively, if
      there are many short flows then the proposed algorithm may have to
      compete with the flows as if they were long lived TCP flows.
      [Editor's Note: many and few short TCP flows may depend on the
      bottleneck link capacity.]


6.  Status of Proposals

   Congestion control algorithms are expected to be published as
   "Experimental" documents until they are shown to be safe to deploy.
   An algorithm published as a draft should be experimented in
   simulation, or a controlled environment (testbed) to show its
   applicability.  Every congestion control algorithm should include a
   note describing the environments in which the algorithm is tested and
   safe to deploy.  It is possible that an algorithm is not recommended
   for certain environments or perform sub-optimally for the user.

   [Editor's Note: Should there be a distinction between "Informational"
   and "Experimental" drafts for congestion control algorithms in RMCAT.
   [RFC5033] describes Informational proposals as algorithms that are
   not safe for deployment but are proposals to experiment with in
   simulation/testbeds.  While Experimental algorithms are ones that are
   deemed safe in some environments but require a more thorough
   evaluation (from the community).]


7.  Security Considerations

   Security issues have not been discussed in this memo.  However,
   sending more media data than the available end-to-end capacity may
   cause a congestion collapse.


8.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA impacts in this memo.
