IETF 85 WEEK
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday: (From: http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/rmcat/current/msg00203.html)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The discussion yielded the following application scenarios
(network scenarios/link characteristics will be discussed
separately):

0. Single Flow (no fairness)
1. Competing with the same/homogeneous flows
    (i.e., all flows are interactive multimedia)
2. Competing with long-lived TCP
3. Competing with bursty TCP
4. Competing with bitorrent/LEDBAT.
5. Competing with unresponsive interactive multimedia
    (i.e., not only CBR)
---
6. Competing with data-channel
    (probably covered by bursty/long-lived tcp flows?)

Friday:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of discussion (at the IETF):
 - A minimum set of application scenarios for fairness.

- A long discussion on fairness for the application scenarios,
which lead to decision on logging: RTP timestamp, sequence number, 
packet size, sent or receive timestamp (+?) for each RTP flow 
at both the endpoints. Plot the delay and throughput curves from this.

- Correct me if I am wrong: but the decision was to start with
something simple for fairness and adapt the definition for each
scenario.

Agenda:
5 mins: Recap of meeting
Rest: How to proceed with the Fairness criteria

At the IETF we discussed
- application scenarios for fairness
- discussion on fairness
- packet logs for flows

What is missing:
- network scenarios
- link characteristics
